<h3>Soot Output View</h3>
<p>This view is where you will see the output generated while running Soot. It behaves much like the Java Console view, but it is much simpler.</p>
<p>You do not need to do anything special to see this view, it is created and given focus as needed. If you accidently close it and want to re-display it. You can do so by selecting Window -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other -&gt; Soot -&gt; Soot Output.</p>

This is a start of a basic set of tests intended to exercise the API
functions available in the jas and scm packages. It is not complete by
any means.

all.java tries to touch as much of the jas API as it can, generating a
non functional class called regress.class. all.jas does
something similar, but for the scm package.

  Once the jas and scm packages are compiled, do this:

  % (cd ..; javac -d . tests/all.java; java all; cmp regress.class tests/regress.class)
  % (cd ..; java scm.driver tests/all.jas; cmp scmregress.class tests/scmregress.class)


If both these complete silently, you are in good shape. Otherwise,
mail me a bug report and enough details for me to replicate it :)

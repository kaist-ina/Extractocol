This directory is for unit tests, test scaffolding, and other
source code which should be kept in Soot's source repository, but
which is not part of Soot proper (i.e., the classes generated
from this code should not be included in a Soot jar file).

The contents are organized in a directory tree that parallels the
structure of the src directory. This allows test code to be in
the same packages as the code being tested, for cases where unit
tests need access to package-private internals of the tested
classes.

<h3>Folder Actions</h3>
<p>These actions are available when one right clicks on a Package Fragment Root (for example a folder of classes).
<p>If the Package Fragment Root contains source files instead of class files Soot will not process anything. This may be changed in the future.</p>

<h5>Actions Available</h5>
<ul>
<li><tt>Dava Decompile</tt> - Selecting this menu item will cause Soot to decompile every class file in the folder, creating a new Java file for each one.</li>
</ul>

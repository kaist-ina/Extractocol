Soot in Eclipse Plugin

The plugin currently works with the release candidate version R3 of Eclipse and the development version of Soot.

The plugin is set up to find Soot in a Soot classes directory containing
class files. If you use a sootclasses jar instead of a directory of
classes, edit the .classpath file in this directory:

uncomment the <classpathentry kind="lib" path="sootclasses.jar"/> line
and comment the <classpathentry kind="lib" path="soot/classes/"/> line

Install Eclipse somewhere, change to the plugins directory
in the Eclipse installation, and enter:
mkdir -p ca.mcgill.sable.soot/soot

Put a symlink called classes in this ca.mcgill.sable.soot/soot directory
to the classes directory of your Soot installation (or, if you are using
a jar file, put a symlink called sootclasses.jar in ca.mcgill.sable.soot
to the sootclasses jar file).

Put a symlink called jasminclasses-sable-1.2.jar in ca.mcgill.sable.soot
to the jasminclasses-sable-1.2.jar file that you can download from the
Soot download page.

example:
ln -s `pwd`/jasminclasses-sable-1.2.jar eclipse/plugins/ca.mcgill.sable.soot/jasminclasses-sable-1.2.jar
ln -s `pwd`/classes ../eclipse/plugins/ca.mcgill.sable.soot/soot/classes

To create soot-plugin.jar jar file: 

mkdir classes

edit Makefile and set the variables:
ECLIPSE_HOME
SOOT_DIR

run make

To Set-up:

cp to eclipse/plugins/ca.mcgill.sable.soot/  dir:
soot-plugin.jar
plugin.xml
plugin.properties

Make a directory eclipse/plugins/ca.mcgill.sable.soot/icons and copy
icons/*.jpg and icons/*.gif to it.

Restart Eclipse

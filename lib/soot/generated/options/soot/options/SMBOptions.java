     * singer declared as a Singer) are in fact Bird objects (Bird

     * Bird.staticsing(singer). Bird.staticsing() may perform 
     * operations on its parameter which are only allowed on Birds, 
     * rather than Singers. The Insert Redundant Casts option inserts 
     * a cast of singer to the Bird type, to prevent complaints from 
     * the verifier.

/**
 *  This class  must be extended  by Attributes that can 
 *  be emitted in Jasmin. The attributes must format their data
 *  in Base64 and if Unit references they may contain must be emitted as
 *  labels embedded and
 *  escaped in the attribute's Base64 data stream at the location where the value
 *  of their pc is to occur. For example:
<pre> 
    aload_1
    iload_2
    label2:
    iaload
 label3:
    iastore
    iinc 2 1
    label0:
    iload_2
    aload_0
    arraylength
 label4:
   if_icmplt label1
   return
 .code_attribute ArrayCheckAttribute "%label2%Aw==%label3%Ag==%label4%Ag=="

</pre>

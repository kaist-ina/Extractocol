A Brief Overview of Shimple                     
===========================
                                                                     
This document briefly describes Shimple, an SSA variant of Soot's
Jimple internal representation. It assumes general knowledge of Soot,
Jimple and SSA form. You may wish to jump directly to the
walk-through section for a demonstration of why you might be
interested in using Shimple either by implementing analyses or by
applying existing optimizations.


Why Shimple?
============

Static Single Assignment (SSA) form guarantees a single static
definition point for every variable used in a program, thereby
significantly simplifying as well as enabling certain analyses.

Shimple provides you with an IR in SSA form that is almost entirely
identical to Jimple except for the introduction of Phi nodes. The
idea is that Shimple can be treated almost identically to Jimple with
the added benefits of SSA.

For example, the additional variable splitting due to SSA form may
turn a previously flow-insensitive analysis into a flow-sensitive one
with little or no additional work.


Hacking Overview
================

The public API of Shimple is fully described in the Soot API
documentation. In particular, in the soot.shimple package, the 
Shimple class provides the Shimple grammar constructors and various
utility functions, the ShimpleBody class describes Shimple bodies and
PhiExpr provides the interface to Phi expressions.

Use/Definition and Definition/Use chains for Shimple bodies can be
obtained with ShimpleLocalDefs or ShimpleLocalUses available in
package soot.shimple.toolkits.scalar.

Currently, the only Shimple optimization available is the powerful,
control flow aware, SConstantPropagatorAndFolder. The latter as well
as some simple Shimple analyses are available in package 
soot.shimple.toolkits.scalar. Please consult the Soot source for
details.


Usage Options
=============

For a full description of the options and phases pertaining to
Shimple, please consult the primary Soot option and phase
documentation.


Command Line Walk Through
=========================

For fun, you may wish to run Shimple from the command-line and study
its output. Consider the following (compiled) Java code:

public int test()
{
    int x = 100;
        
    while(doIt){
        if(x < 200)
            x = 100;
        else
            x = 200;
    }

    return x;
}


Producing Jimple
----------------

If you produce Jimple with `soot.Main -f jimple ShimpleTest' you
obtain the following code for the test() method:

        i0 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0 >= 200 goto label1;

        i0 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label1:
        i0 = 200;

     label2:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0;


Producing Shimple
-----------------

To produce Shimple instead, use `soot.Main -f shimple ShimpleTest':

        i0 = 100;
(0)     goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0_1 >= 200 goto label1;

        i0_2 = 100;
(1)     goto label2;

     label1:
(2)     i0_3 = 200;

     label2:
        i0_1 = Phi(i0 #0, i0_3 #2, i0_2 #1);
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0_1;

The difference between the Jimple and Shimple output is that the
latter guarantees unique local definition points in the program (for
scalars). Notice here that the variable i0 has been split into the
four variables i0, i0_1, i0_2 and i0_3, each with a unique definition
point.

We have also introduced a Phi node. You can read `i0_1 = Phi(i0 #0,
i0_3 #2, i0_2 #1)' as saying that i0_1 will be assigned value i0 if
control flow comes from unit #0 or it will be assigned i0_3 if
control flow comes from unit #2 or... and so on.

If you have a prejudice against variable names with underscores, you
may use `soot.Main -f shimple -p shimple standard-local-names
ShimpleTest' instead so that Shimple applies the Local Name
Standardizer each time new locals are introduced.

Feel free to skip the following digression and move on to the next
subsection.


A Digression on Shimple Pointers
--------------------------------

Because Soot represents the body of a method internally as a Unit
chain, we need to store explicit pointers (such as #0 and #1 in the
above example) to keep track of the control flow predecessors of the
Phi statements.

Shimple's internal implementation of PatchingChain attempts to move
and maintain these pointers in a manner that will be as transparent
as possible to the user. For example, in the simplest case, if a
statement is appended to block:

     label0:
(1)     i0_1 = 1000;

to obtain:

     label0:
        i0_1 = 1000;
(1)     new_stmt;

Shimple will automatically move the #1 pointer down to the new
statement since it is in the same basic block.

The intent is to provide maximum flexibility for code motion
optimizations as well as other transformations. In this case, i0_1 =
1000 is free to move up or down the Unit chain as long as the new
location dominates the original CFG block it was in.


Producing Jimple, Again
-----------------------

Since we eventually have to get rid of those pesky Phi nodes, you may
wish to see what the code looks like after going from Jimple to
Shimple and back again to Jimple. Do this with `java soot.Main -f
jimple -via-shimple ShimpleTest':

        i0_1 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0_1 >= 200 goto label1;

        i0_1 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label1:
        i0_1 = 200;

     label2:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0_1;

Happily, in this case, the Jimple produced looks exactly like the
original Jimple code. As usual you may specify `-p shimple
standard-local-names' if the underscores hurt your eyes; they are
otherwise quite harmless.

To understand what's really going on when Shimple eliminates Phi
nodes, you can tell it to eliminate them naively with `soot.Main -f
jimple -via-shimple -p shimple ShimpleTest':

        i0 = 100;
        i0_1 = i0;
        goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0_1 >= 200 goto label1;

        i0_2 = 100;
        i0_1 = i0_2;
        goto label2;

     label1:
        i0_3 = 200;
        i0_1 = i0_3;

     label2:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0_1;

Now you can see that all Shimple did was to replace the Phi node
with equivalent copy statements.


Applying Shimple Optimizations
------------------------------

So, what good is Shimple?

If you were paying attention, you may have noticed that despite the
control flow and different assignments to x, x is in fact a constant
100 and is only ever used by a single return statement. In other
words, all the computations are quite useless.  Obviously, this needs 
to be optimized away.

Let's try to apply Jimple's Constant Propagator and Folder. In fact,
to be fair, let's try all the available Jimple optimizations
activated with `soot.Main -f jimple -O ShimpleTest':

        i0 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0 >= 200 goto label1;

        i0 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label1:
        i0 = 200;

     label2:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0;

As you can see in this case, the Jimple optimizations failed to
deduce that x is a constant. Jimple may be forgiven for this since 
reasoning about control flow is not always an easy task to automate. 
Shimple, on the other hand, encodes control flow information
explicitly in the Phi nodes thereby allowing optimizations to make 
use of the information.

Currently, the only optimization we have implemented specifically for
Shimple is a version of the powerful constant propagation algorithm
sketched by the Cytron et el. The implementation can reason about
control flow and can currently handle the conditional branching
statements IfStmt, TableSwitchStmt and LookupSwitchStmt.

Let's apply it with `soot.Main -f jimple -via-shimple -O
ShimpleTest':

     label0:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return 100;

Et voila, Shimple optimized out the x variable completely. What
happened is that the optimization propagated reachable definitions to
the Phi node and then noticed that the Phi node was useless (because
it made a selection from identical values) and therefore trimmed it
out. In the process, dead code was exposed which was ultimately
eliminated.

To understand what is really going on, you can look at the output
from `soot.Main -f shimple -p sop on', `soot.Main -f shimple -p sop
on -p sop.cpf prune-cfg:false' and `soot.Main -f jimple -via-shimple
-p shimple -p sop on -p sop.cpf prune-cfg:false' 
on this and other examples:

public int test2()
{
    int i = 1000;
    int j = 1000;

    while(doIt){
        if(i == j){
            if(anotherIt)
                i = j;
            else
                j = i;
        }
        else{
            i = 5;
            j = 6;
        }
    }

    return i + j;
}


Thanks and Credits
==================

Thanks and credits go alphabetically to Laurie Hendren, John
Jorgensen, Patrick Lam and Ondrej Lhotak for helping with the design
of Shimple and general implementation issues.  I am most grateful
for their help and advice.


Future Work
===========

Much more work on Shimple is planned as the project is likely to
morph into a Master's thesis. Some thoughts currently include
investigating the various scalar SSA variants as well as heap, array
and possibly concurrent forms of SSA. The Shimple architecture and
implementation will therefore evolve quite a bit internally, but as
far as possible we will try to maintain backwards-compatibility for
the public interfaces.

Suggestions, improvements and bug reports/fixes welcome! Please send
these either to the Soot mailing list at soot-list@sable.mcgill.ca,
or directly to myself at navindra@cs.mcgill.ca.


Partial To-Do List
------------------

  * Implement more SSA-based analyses.
  * Add timers and profiling code.
  * Make internal analyses more useful and generic for external use.
  * Adopt an Strategy-type pattern for SSA builder modules, etc.
  * Implement a Shimple parser.
  * Provide an interface for CFG manipulations that intelligently
    updates Phi nodes.
  * Implement a Control Dependence Graph? Any interest in that?


Known Issues
------------

A vague description of a couple of known issues follows. You may
ignore this section completely since regular usage of Shimple should
not be affected in general.

Issue 1

One issue is related to Phi nodes inserted at the beginning of try
blocks which are subsequently used by Phi nodes in the corresponding
handler block. Fortunately, although the code produced looks strange
it is not incorrect. Example:

    label1:
        i0_2 = Phi(i0 #0, i0_1 #1);
(2)     i1 = 4 / 0;
(3)     i0_3 = i0_2 / 0;
        i2 = i0_3;

     label2:
        goto label4;

     label3:
        $r0 := @caughtexception;
        i0_4 = Phi(i0_1 #1, i0 #0, i0_2 #2, i0_3 #3);

        catch java.lang.Exception from label1 to label2 with label3;

The #2 pointer of the second Phi node really should be pointing
directly at the first Phi node instead of at the statement following
it (since the latter may throw an exception and branch to the handler
block). Fortunately, in these cases the second Phi node will always
be pointing directly at the predecessors of the first Phi node as
well (#0 and #1 in this example), rendering the matter moot. This
glitch will be eliminated in a future release.

Issue 2

Another issue is related to the Shimple patching algorithm. In the
rare case that control flow falls through from an if statement to a
try block and the if statement has a pointer to it:

       value = 1000;
(1)    if (whatever) goto label100;

label1:
       first_trap_statement;
       ...
       goto label100;
label2:
       $r0 := @caughtexception;
       i0 = Phi(value #1, ...);

In the above, it may be desireable to move the #1 pointer down if a
Unit happens to be inserted after the if statement. Although Shimple
is smart enough to do this in most known cases, it currently misses
the one case where control flows from an if statement in a
non-exceptional context to an exceptional context.

This is not a big problem for most people unless an exotic code
motion algorithm (currently non-existent in Soot) attempts to move
the definition of value below the if statement for some reason.

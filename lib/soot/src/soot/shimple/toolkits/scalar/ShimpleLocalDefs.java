/**
 * This class implements the LocalDefs interface for Shimple.
 * ShimpleLocalDefs can be used in conjunction with SimpleLocalUses to
 * provide Definition/Use and Use/Definition chains in SSA.
 *
 * <p> This implementation can be considered a small demo for how SSA
 * can be put to good use since it is much simpler than
 * soot.toolkits.scalar.SimpleLocalDefs. Shimple can often be treated
 * as Jimple with the added benefits of SSA assumptions.
 *
 * <p> In addition to the interface required by LocalDefs,
 * ShimpleLocalDefs also provides a method for obtaining the
 * definition Unit given only the Local.

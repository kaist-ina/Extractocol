IFDS:
	Have simpler templates for flow functions.
		Should be efficient, do not create too many sets.	
	Create binary sets.
	Separate normal return from throw flow functions?
	Useful templates
		Template for local-variable tracking analyses		
	Performance optimizations	
	Implement subsumtion as in CC'10 paper
	
	Notes:
		Could it be that RHS even works for infinite domains?

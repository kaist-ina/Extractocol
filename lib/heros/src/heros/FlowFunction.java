/**
 * A flow function computes which of the finitely many D-type values are reachable
 * from the current source values. Typically there will be one such function
 * associated with every possible control flow. 
 * 
 * <b>NOTE:</b> To be able to produce <b>deterministic benchmarking results</b>, we have found that
 * it helps to return {@link LinkedHashSet}s from {@link #computeTargets(Object)}. This is
 * because the duration of IDE's fixed point iteration may depend on the iteration order.
 * Within the solver, we have tried to fix this order as much as possible, but the
 * order, in general, does also depend on the order in which the result set
 * of {@link #computeTargets(Object)} is traversed.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Methods defined on this type may be called simultaneously by different threads.
 * Hence, classes implementing this interface should synchronize accesses to
 * any mutable shared state.
 * 
 * @param <D> The type of data-flow facts to be computed by the tabulation problem.
